1. **U.S.-China Trade Policy**: 
   - The pending implementation of reciprocal tariffs under President Trump (deadline July 9) casts uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations. Historical context suggests potential market dips arising from reintroduced tariffs, but some analysts maintain a belief in resilient investor confidence based on past tariff negotiations.

1. **Stock Performance**:
   - Tesla (TSLA) stock fell significantly recently, showing a 14% decline in vehicle deliveries year-over-year for Q2—marking its second consecutive quarterly drop. Despite the challenging environment, recent reports showed a slight recovery in China-made vehicle sales.
