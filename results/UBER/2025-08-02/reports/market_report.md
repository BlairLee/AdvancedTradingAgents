FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY/HOLD/SELL**

Based on the current market trends and technical analysis of UBER's stock data from August 1st to 2nd, 2025, I recommend a neutral stance with a slight bias towards buying.

**Moving Averages:**
The short-term close_10_ema (10 EMA) is currently at $86.91, which shows some upward momentum. The medium-term close_50_sma (50 SMA) is at $85.42, indicating a slightly bearish trend direction.

**MACD Related:**
The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, suggesting a potential buy signal. However, this should be confirmed with additional indicators and analysis. The MACDHistogram is showing some volatility but does not provide clear Buy/ Sell signals yet.

**Momentum Indicators:**
The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 56.43, indicating that the stock is still oversold but has started to recover from its lows.

**Volatility Indicators:**
Bollinger Middle Band (20 SMA) is at $86.50, which marks the current price zone. There are no significant deviations from this band, suggesting low volatility for now.

**Volume-Based Indicators:**
VWMA (Volume-Weighted MA) has a similar value to Bollinger Middle Band (20 SMA), reinforcing the stability of the market conditions.

Market Context:
The stock price is in a sideways movement with some upward momentum. A possible Buy could be executed when the MACD line confirms its position above the signal line, when RSI crosses above 60 and there's increased volume activity, or if we see an increase in trading volume on this symbol for the past 3 days.

| Indicator | Trend/Advice |
| --- | --- |
| Close_10_EMA | Upward momentum possible |
| Close_50_Sma | Bearish trend direction |
| MACD | Potential Buy signal pending confirmation |
| RSI | Oversold state recovering, but still undetermined if it will break above 60 to confirm a clear buy signal. |
| Bollinger Middle Band | Low volatility for now, |
| VWMA | Stable market conditions are given by this tool |

For trader needs: Consider buying UBER around $87 as an alternative to the strong buy suggestion based on MACD crossovers which seems high, considering current price is lower than signal line at around 8 am on August 2nd.
