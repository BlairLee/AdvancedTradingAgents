### Current State of the World - Macroeconomic Analysis (as of July 8, 2025)

#### Macroeconomic Developments

Between July 1 and July 8, 2025, several key macroeconomic factors and trade policies have influenced market conditions, particularly relevant for traders and investors:

1. **U.S. Trade Policy and Tariffs**:
   - On July 8, President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, with Japan facing a 25% tariff. This move is more severe than the initially expected 24% and has contributed to volatility in equity markets. As a result, U.S. stock futures fell, while gold prices surged, demonstrating a flight to safety.
   - The Federal Reserve faces challenges balancing economic growth support with rising inflation concerns, as businesses navigate tariffs and ongoing trade policy uncertainty. Various executives project higher prices amidst weaker revenue.

2. **Global Trade Dynamics**:
   - The European Union is nearing an agreement with the U.S. that includes higher tariffs than those vis-a-vis the UK. This deal could stress EU economies, raising concerns among European officials.
   - Rising tensions and potential supply chain disruptions due to trade policies might lead businesses to curtail investments and adjust their supply chains.

3. **Commodity Markets**:
   - Gold prices increased by 25% in 2025 up to July 8, reaching peak values prompted by geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. As a traditional safe-haven asset, gold’s value is expected to remain volatile given the evolving global economic landscape.

4. **Upcoming Economic Indicators**:
   - A series of important economic indicators are set to be released this week, including Australia’s Reserve Bank Interest Rate Decision (July 8), China’s Consumer Price and Producer Price Indices (July 9), South Korea’s Bank of Korea Interest Rate Decision (July 10), and the U.S. Monthly Budget Statement (July 11). These reports will be essential to shaping market sentiment moving forward.

2. **Bank Charter Application**:
